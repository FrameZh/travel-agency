# travel-agency

This is my first project using Flexbox to arrange the layout of a Travel Agency homepage.
It is a project I made for The Odin Project foundations course.
I had a lot of fun and it was really useful to practise my skills. I learned the basics of
Flexbox and this is the result. I hope you will like it.
